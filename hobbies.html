                <h1>HOBBIES & INTERESTS</h1><hr>
                <h1>1</h1>
                   <p> I am an amateur actor, singer and has not only helped to organize school plays
                    but also played parts in them. I am also fond of learning Veda and spiritual
                    books.</p>
                    <h1>2</h1>
                    <p>I absolutely love cooking. I can merrily state that my kitchen is my playground
                         in every sense! My mother has always been a wonderful cook, and I feel she is my inspiration,
                        I have seen her prepare scrumptious meals for hundreds of guests in a few hours
                        Honestly, I find cooking very therapeutic and look forward to planning my meals every day.
                        Besides, my family and friends have always been very patient and supportive, 
                        and It‚Äôs only due to their encouragement and constructive criticism that I‚Äôve gotten better at my hobby. 
                      Other than cooking, I like watching lifestyle channels and food shows.</p>

                        <h1>3</h1>
                        <p>I have always been a very creative person and find it relaxing to indulge in craft activities.
                            There is a new modern term for this; ‚ÄòDo-It-Yourself‚Äô or DIY.  
                            It largely means to create handmade products and includes a gamut of different crafts.
                            Most of these ideas are relatively cheap and I love taking on new projects for home improvement.
                            It keeps me occupied and enables me to think on my feet to create new designs. 
                            Furthermore, I am lucky that I can make personalized gifts for close friends and family. 
                            It‚Äôs a gesture they never forget!</p>

                            <h1>4</h1>
                            <p>I take pleasure in listening to music. I never really thought that this was my hobby,
                                 but I‚Äôm beginning to comprehend that it is.I understand that hobbies are 
                                 activities that a person actively follows and enjoys.
                                I listen to music every morning and every night.
                                In addition to that, I spend time on music websites to search for the latest artists 
                                and albums in my favourite genres.I like attending music concerts and 
                                stay updated on the music scene in my city.</p><hr>
