                 operations of persistent storage. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user 
                 interface conventionsthat facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information 
                 using computer-based form and reports.</p></td>

                       For example, the basic storage unit is an individual contact entry. As a bare minimum,
                        the software must allow the user to:

                    Create, or add new entries
                    Read, retrieve, search, or view existing entries
                    Update, or edit existing entries
                    Delete, deactivate, or remove existing entries
                    Because these operations are so fundamental, they are often documented and described 
                    under one comprehensive heading such as "contact management" or "document management" 
                    in general.</p></td>

             allows the hotel manager to handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI 
             and the ability to manage various hotel bookings and rooms make this system very
              flexible and convenient. The hotel manager is a very busy person and does not have
               the time to sit and manage the entire activities manually on paper. This
                application gives him the power and flexibility to manage the entire system from 
                a single online system. Hotel management project provides room booking, staff 
                management and other necessary hotel management features. The system allows the 
                manager to post available rooms in the system. Customers can view and book room online.
                 Admin has the power of either approving or disapproving the customer‚Äôs booking request.
                  Other hotel services can also be viewed by the customers and can book them too.
                   The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to portable manage the 
                   hotel activities.</p></td>
